# Loan Application Analysis

## Aim
The goal of this project is to gain accurate insights into loan application data, including total distributed and received amounts, average interest rates, average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios, loan purposes, and the classification of good vs. bad loans. The analysis aims to assess the current situation of the loan portfolio.

## Problem Statement
Examine the correlation between various factors such as total loan applications, average Debt-to-Income ratio, average interest rate, loan purpose, and repayment behavior (good loan vs. bad loan). Utilize this analysis to identify significant trends, potential risk factors, and areas for improvement in loan origination, underwriting processes, and customer segmentation strategies to enhance loan portfolio performance and mitigate credit risk effectively.

## Approach
1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess loan application data using Excel to ensure accuracy and completeness.
2. **Data Analysis**: Use Tableau to create visualizations that compare factors such as Debt-to-Income ratio, interest rates, and loan purpose between good and bad loans.
3. **Trend Identification**: Identify significant trends and correlations among loan attributes through Tableau dashboards and reports.
4. **Insight Generation**: Derive actionable insights to optimize loan portfolio performance and minimize credit losses.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial analysis.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards to explore and present data insights.
