# Loan Application Analysis

## Aim
The goal of this project is to gain accurate insights into loan application data, including total distributed and received amounts, average interest rates, average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios, loan purposes, and classification of good vs. bad loans. The analysis aims to assess the current situation of the loan portfolio.

## Problem Statement
Examine the correlation between various factors such as total loan applications, average Debt-to-Income ratio, average interest rate, loan purpose, and repayment behavior (good loan vs. bad loan). Utilize this analysis to identify significant trends, potential risk factors, and areas for improvement in loan origination, underwriting processes, and customer segmentation strategies to enhance loan portfolio performance and mitigate credit risk effectively.

## Approach
1. **Data Analysis**: Analyze loan application data to compare factors such as Debt-to-Income ratio, interest rates, and loan purpose between good and bad loans.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Apply statistical techniques to identify trends and correlations among the loan attributes.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop predictive models to assess risk factors and improve loan approval processes.
4. **Actionable Insights**: Generate actionable insights to optimize loan portfolio performance and reduce credit losses.
